-DIfference between Django projects and django app.

Django app: are subsets of main project.
    i.e: lets take instagram for example, instagram can
    the main project, while other sections such as DM can
    be a django app, other section can include, feeds,
    profile,Reels, story, etc. This app have a particular
    funtion they do and serve.
N/B: you ca also have one project and one app but the app
     contain multiple features.


##CREATING Django app
-Make sure you in the vir env and also the project Dir.
-create an app in the root dir of the project
N/b: the manage.py file is responsible for creating a
    Django app.
#Create app using manage.py
command: python manage.py startapp (appName)
    i.e: python manage.py startapp firstDjangoApp

#-FIles Created in the App AFter its APp creation
1. init.py: mostly used for migration for the models.
2. admin.py: django has a built in interface that let you
    maintain your site, view all databases and everything
    relating to the site. admin.py is where we register
    databases etc.
3. apps.py: 
4. models.py: this is the file where we create all our
    databases.
5. tests.py: is used in some cases but not frequently
    used.
6. views.py: is where the main things happen.


### Url Mapping or Url Routing
This is the configuration of urls that will be used in that 
particular Django app.
The routing is done from url.py file in the app.
examples of url are, facebook.com, facebook.com/messages
N/b: this are two different Urls.

##Importing path in urls
path helps us import multiple urls in a list.
the list is "urlpattern" and it contains all the url in 
the project.
-command: from django.urls import path

-the list called urlpattern then contain path in which
 every url si specified in.
 Path('', views.index, name='index')

-when the first '' is empty in the path, its spefifys the 
root url.
lets say we want our user to access the download page on our
website, we can specify in the path that /download is another url.
i.e
    path('/download', views.index, name='index')

 -views.index: this is what happens when a user comes to the 
    specified url.
    for views.index to be used, it must be imported.
 -name='index': is the id assign to the url.


### Running Django project 
    running a django app occurs with the help of the
manage.py file
    command: 
            python manage.py runserver

N/B - After the app which is (firstDjangoAPp) which
also is the subset of the of the main Django project called
my project; after it runs we need to configure it to look
 for our own urls that we ve configured in the app:
 --summary is, we configure project to look for app urls.

#- we then head to myProject > urls
and import include from django.urls

which will allow us to implement simililar urls used in an
app on the main project.
 A new Path will be then cretaed in the urlpattern
    path('', include('firstDjangoApp.urls'))
 you can then run the server from cmd and the url will be 
 rendered and the default django theme would be gone.
