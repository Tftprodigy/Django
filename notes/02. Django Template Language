### Making Django Locate files like html.
- in most cases we cant always type our markup language
  from scractch to get http response, we need to make Django
  located these files.

#-Head to root dir, (root dir in a Django project is the
 folder originally containing the manage.py file)
 create new folder called templates, which will contain
 our templates files.

 #Configure DJANGO TO LOCATE TEMPLATES And render HTml files in a 
 #Django url.
 in order to get Djangoto located this new template folder
  we head to MYPROJECT > SETTINGS.py
  in the setting.py, we locate template list and dir list
  located in templates list.
  command:

  'DIRS': [BASE_DIR, 'templates'],
  
  which is basically saying "go to the base dir, or root
  dir and locate a folder called template.
  
  we can then start working with templates files.

 NOw, in our views.py ,we don't want to return httpresponse
 anymore since we are working with templates files.
 what we want to do is render those files.

    so in the views our function will return a renter 
    instead of httpresponse
        command:
    def index(request):
     return render(request, 'index.html')

   where index.html is the rendered file name.
   this file should be then rendered on the server.
   N/B: it works ;)
